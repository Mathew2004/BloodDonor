<h1>Blood Donor Website <a href="https://blooddonor.pythonanywhere.com/">Visit</a></h1>

Excited to share my latest achievement! In just 12 days, I've learned Django and develop a Blood Donating Website from scratch. Now, users can easily create profiles, search for donors by blood group, and connect with potential lifesavers. It's incredibly fulfilling to leverage technology for a meaningful cause.Here's a breakdown of how your website works:

Step 1: Account Creation

Upon entering the website, users are prompted to create an account. During the signup process, users provide their essential details such as name, mobile number, blood group, address, and a user password. This information will serve as their profile on the website.

Step 2: Home Page Display

Once the account is created, the user's information is displayed on the website's home page. This creates a centralized platform where all registered users and their details are showcased.

Step 3: Blood Group Search

When someone is in urgent need of a specific blood type (e.g., B positive), they can visit the website and search for donors with that blood group. The website's search feature allows users to find registered donors with the required blood group. This functionality is incredibly valuable in connecting those in need with potential donors quickly.

Step 4: Accessing Contact Details

Upon finding a donor with the needed blood group, the user can access their profile, which includes their mobile number and location. This ensures a direct and efficient means of reaching out to potential donors.

Sharing Stories and Feedback

Users have the option to share their experiences and stories related to blood donation. The "Share Story" page allows them to contribute their personal narratives, and these stories are then displayed on the website's homepage. This not only creates a sense of community but also inspires others to participate and contribute.
